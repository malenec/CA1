            <li>Who was active during this sprint?
                <ul>
                    <li>All 4 members of the group have been 100% active during this sprint.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Who did what, during this sprint?
                <ul>
                    <li>We have all 4 been involved in every single step together during this sprint. We have taken turns at being the one who does the coding and at being copilots. This has worked perfectly during the first iteration as this sprint solely entailed set up of the overall system and therefore was not obvious to divide between us. We have also been able to solve issues quickly with the shared amount of knowledge between all of us - there was always at least 1 person who remembered an important detail from class or previous projects, that was the key to the solution. This has made the sprint run smooth and fast from beginning till end.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>What did your team accomplish during this sprint?

                    <li>User stories have been written</li>
                    <li>Estimation game has been played and all user stories have been given a t-shirt size estimate as a result of this game</li>
                    <li>Startcode has been set up</li>

            <li>Goal: REST API + Rest assured + error handling </li>

            <li>Who was active during this sprint?
                <ul>
                    <li>Again all 4 members of the group have been 100% active during this sprint.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Who did what, during this sprint?
                <ul>
                    <li>We have used the same strategy as for the previous sprint. We have again all 4 been involved in every single step together during this sprint, and we have again taken turns at being the one who does the coding and at being copilots. During this sprint we have made this choice, because the code has caused us so many headaches - all four of us - that we have had no other option than to have all men on deck to solve the issues at hand. We have been surprised at how many problems we’ve run into, and every single time without exception the solution has been a minor detail that needed to be changed in order for everything to work as expected. But this has not been due to an overlook over something silly like a semicolon etc., but very fundamental things caused by holes in our understanding of these new areas and tools we’ve been introduced to this semester.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What did your team accomplish during this sprint?
                <ul>
                    <li>We have NOT completed anywhere near all tasks suggested for the second iteration, if the expectation was that the backend was pretty much done this evening - but we have made managed to make GET, POST and PUT endpoints, which was perhaps the most important goal to accomplish during this sprint:</li>
                    <li>Database has been redesigned</li>
                    <li>Entities have been regenerated (A LOT of times)</li>
                    <li>DTOs have been created for all entities</li>
                    <li>Tests have been generated before methods (TDD - which we are proud of during all the other challenges we’ve fought through)</li>
                    <li>Populator has been created</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>getPersonbyId</li>

                        </ul>
                    <li>Database has been filled up with sample data for persons including all possible information a person can have like address, phones and hobbies </li>
                    <li>The following methods have been created</li>
                    <li>Resources for each method have been created</li>
                    <li>Endpoints for each method have been created</li>
                    <li>KanBan using Trello has been further color-coded as well as updated continuously and again last but not least screenshot at the beginning and end of the sprint</li>
                    <li>Updated diagram has been generated for each package at the end of the sprint</li>
                    <li>All relevant documentation has been deployed including this diary as well as an updated API documentation and all links that are asked of us to provide</li>
